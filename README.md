# Leaflet-Challenge
Step 1 of this leaflet project maps out the last 7 days of earthquakes, with the magnitude affecting the radius, and the depth affecting the color.

Step 2 adds a control functionality and another dataset, this one containing the tectonic plates, both of which are toggleable. It also adds an option for the base map to be light or dark.
